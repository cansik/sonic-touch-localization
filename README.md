# Surface Touch Localization
Touch localization on a tabletop with the use of multiple microphones.

## Idea
A basic interaction is the tapping of interface elements with your finger. On a tabletop touch sensors are expensive and complex to install. The recognition via camera (as Kinect) is unreliable due to the low depth resolution. An alternative is the detection by the noise which is generated by the finger contact with the table surface. For this four microphones are attached to the table surface which then determine the position by latency differences of the sonic.
